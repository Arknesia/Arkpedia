# Item Tiers

## What Are Item Tiers

Item tiers represent the quality, rarity, and power level of weapons and equipment in the server. As players progress through their journey, they will encounter items of increasing strength, from broken scraps to legendary artifacts infused with divine energy.

Each tier reflects an item’s history, materials, and magical properties. Lower-tier weapons are common and easily accessible, while higher-tier weapons are rare and often require great effort to obtain.

## Item Tier List

There are a total of 7 main item tiers, ranging from Common to Mythic, with two special tiers: Trash (below Common) and Unique (beyond Mythic).

| Tier      | Color Code       | Description                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trash     | `&8` (Dark Gray) | Broken, useless scraps, barely usable as weapons.                          |
| Common    | `&7` (Gray)      | Basic weapons used by soldiers and adventurers.                            |
| Uncommon  | `&a` (Green)     | Slightly enhanced weapons, forged with better materials.                   |
| Rare      | `&9` (Blue)      | Powerful weapons with historical significance.                             |
| Epic      | `&5` (Purple)    | Artifacts crafted by master blacksmiths, infused with magic.               |
| Legendary | `&6` (Gold)      | Weapons of heroes and mythical beings, wielded in history-shaping battles. |
| Mythic    | `&d` (Pink)      | Weapons beyond mortal comprehension, with power rivaling the gods.         |
| Unique    | `&c` (Red)       | One-of-a-kind weapons with unique abilities and a destiny of their own.    |
